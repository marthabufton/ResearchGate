Comforting, because these are topics of great interest to academic librarians. For example, we have a scholarly communications librarian whose job includes assisting faculty members set up their ORCID accounts (which aligns with part of the argument put forward by Radford, et. al. about the role that librarians can play in supporting faulty as they attempt to track the impact of their work on various academic communities.

I had the opportunity to tidy myself up a bit through this activity. Turns out, I’d forgotten that I’d created both an Academic.edu and a ResearchGate account a few years ago. I remembered that I had wanted to learn more about the tools because these social networking sites were coming up in conversatons with faculty and I wanted to know more about how they worked. I also have an ORCID number (although I had to reset the password).

I chose to close my Academic.edu account because I didn’t like the immediate push to “upgrade” my account and spend more money (what if you’re a grad student or emerging scholar and your funds are limited?), plus the interface just doesn’t appeal to me aesthetically. I opted for ResearchGate because my user experience is better--no “asks” for money and a cleaner interface that (to me) reads more like an online CV
In addition, I discover that I was already being “followed” by two scholars that I now personally: Teresa Welsh, who is a library and information science scholar from the University of Southern Mississippi (“Southern Miss”). I took a course from Teresa during my library science grad work. And Amanda Murphyao, who is finishing up her PhD in Canadian Studies at Carleton.

Now I just have to maintain this profile (and the authors of the articles I read pointed out that being part of these networks does involved a time commitment) and learn to use Twitter (where all the digital humanists hang out).
